          <p>

          <h2>3. Commission</h2>
          <p>
            In return for its intermediary service, the Company receives a commission of <strong>10%</strong> of the total amount excluding VAT 
            of the booking confirmed by the Customer.  
            The commission is payable by the Partner upon firm confirmation of the booking by the Customer.  
            The commission is calculated on the total amount of the nights and services booked by the Customer through the Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any booking cancelled by the Customer does not give rise to the payment of commission, unless cancellation fees are charged by the Partner, 
            in which case the commission also applies to these fees.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Any delay in payment will result, after formal notice, in the application of late payment interest at the legal rate in force,
